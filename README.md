Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development
Firstly,  I created a separate App component, Import and render the App component. I create a Die component that takes a `value` prop, Render 10 instances of the Die component (manually) and  Provide a number between 1-6 for the value on each and then style it.

secondly, Write a function (allNewDice) that returns an array of 10 random numbers between 1-6 inclusive.
 





```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```




Happy Coding!
